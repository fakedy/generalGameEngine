My first real c++ project. In hindsight its pretty bad, there is no separation from engine, editor or the game so its a huge mess. I didnt know that much about c++ or object oriented design when i started this project.
It was a very fun project with many flaws.

Learnopengl.com was used as a resource to help with this project.
